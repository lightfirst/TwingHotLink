#Twing Hot Link - For PSP
--
This is a software that developed for PSP remote connection, the initial motivation of developing was simply for friends team up to play MONSTER HUNTER through USB device. Although it was ready to open source 5 yrs ago, due to my negligence. Till today, the long lost source code was found in my PC, so, here it is.

>说好的开源呢？

之前有人这么问我，那位兄弟对不起，确实忘记了。创业不易，第一次创业失败，清理电脑时找到了源代码，虽然现在已经没什么用处了，但是用来参考参考还是可以的。
